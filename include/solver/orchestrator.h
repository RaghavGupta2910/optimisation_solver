//   classify (before presolve)  ->  presolve  ->  dispatch (after presolve)
//   ->  the chosen engine  ->  postsolve  ->  original-model SolveResult
//
// Classification happens before presolve because presolve's reductions depend
// on the problem class; dispatch happens after because presolve changes the
// size, can eliminate every integer variable, and can settle infeasibility
// outright.
//
// Primal values, shadow prices and reduced costs are reconstructed and validated
// in the original model's coordinates. Presolve runs once, and its same metadata
// is used for reconstruction. Check hasPrimal/hasDuals before consuming vectors.

// Solves a model that has ALREADY been reduced/presolved.
//
// Dispatches directly to the selected engine on `presolvedModel` using the
// `classification` of the original model, and normalises the result into a
// SolveResult in the coordinates of `presolvedModel`.
// Unlike solve(), this does NOT run presolve or expand into another model's
// coordinates or invoke postsolve reconstruction. It validates primal/dual
// results directly against presolvedModel itself.
